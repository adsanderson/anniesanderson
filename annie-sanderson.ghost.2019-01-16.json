You cared for and loved your children deeply; even though sometimes this was not always communicated verbally, your love was unconditional and demonstrated by the actions you took.\n\nIt is still hard to believe you are gone. Our time together was a short one. Knowing I will not hear the familiar voice on the end of the telephone or see your smile during a visit is hard to bear but I know it is something I will eventually come to terms with over time.\n\nMy only comfort is that I know in my heart your legacy will continue on through the lives of your children, grandchildren and great grandchildren. You will never be forgotten but remembered in our hearts and minds until the end of time. I pray you will rest in peace and continue to watch over your loved ones, protecting them, until we all meet again one day in heaven.\n\nLovingly yours,\nAnnie\n\n",

            "markdown": "It's been 8 months (I know, I am little behind on my blog posts!), since our short break to the beautiful cosmopolitan city of Rome, Italy. This is our 4th visit to date and no doubt, not the last. With so much to see and do, you are guaranteed each visit will always be different. I adore Rome. I love the vibrancy, the cultured but tremendously overcrowded streets filled with life, beauty and romance. I love the hospitality of the locals and their desire to make every moment you spend in their enchanted city even more special than the first. \n\nRome, for me, is like a journey into the past, with thousands of years of art, architecture and culture on display for all to see. Exploring on foot the endless tangled lanes of cobbled streets and passing modern buildings are ruins such as Pantheon and Colosseum dating back thousands of years evoking the power of the former Roman Empire, in all its glory and stature.\n\nItaly's eternal city is built on vast history and inspiration and although, this is not my first visit to Rome, I still feel a buzz of excitement when I see the magnificent Colosseum or St Peters Basilica illuminating the Italian skyline.\n\nIf you don't believe me, take some inspiration from some of the photographs I took to capture my holiday experience in Rome.\n\n######1 |**Castel Sant'Angelo**\n\nCastel Sant'Angelo is an hidden gem located in the Vatican City, with its towering cylindrical building and national museum. This fascinating fortress was built as a mausoleum for the Emperor Hadrian (AD130-139) but also a prison and used by former Popes who fled there for protection during times of danger. \n\nI was privileged enough to visit the Sant Angelo castle and National Museum of Castel Sant'Angelo which is like stepping into history, a home to various exhibits ranging from Renaissance paintings, sculptures antique military weapons as my photographs show.\n\n![alt](/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_064024864.jpg)\n\n![alt](/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_063946524.jpg)\n\n![alt](/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_064053454.jpg)\n\n![alt](/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_100014049.jpg)\n\n######2 |**Colosseum**\n\nThe Colosseum or as known in Italian, \"Collesso\", also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre situated in the heart of Rome, Italy. Built of concrete and sand, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built in the history. The Colosseum is located east of the Roman Forum.

            "html": "<p>It's been 8 months (I know, I am little behind on my blog posts!), since our short break to the beautiful cosmopolitan city of Rome, Italy. This is our 4th visit to date and no doubt, not the last. With so much to see and do, you are guaranteed each visit will always be different. I adore Rome. I love the vibrancy, the cultured but tremendously overcrowded streets filled with life, beauty and romance. I love the hospitality of the locals and their desire to make every moment you spend in their enchanted city even more special than the first. </p>\n\n<p>Rome, for me, is like a journey into the past, with thousands of years of art, architecture and culture on display for all to see. Exploring on foot the endless tangled lanes of cobbled streets and passing modern buildings are ruins such as Pantheon and Colosseum dating back thousands of years evoking the power of the former Roman Empire, in all its glory and stature.</p>\n\n<p>Italy's eternal city is built on vast history and inspiration and although, this is not my first visit to Rome, I still feel a buzz of excitement when I see the magnificent Colosseum or St Peters Basilica illuminating the Italian skyline.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't believe me, take some inspiration from some of the photographs I took to capture my holiday experience in Rome.</p>\n\n<h6 id=\"1castelsantangelo\">1 |<strong>Castel Sant'Angelo</strong></h6>\n\n<p>Castel Sant'Angelo is an hidden gem located in the Vatican City, with its towering cylindrical building and national museum. This fascinating fortress was built as a mausoleum for the Emperor Hadrian (AD130-139) but also a prison and used by former Popes who fled there for protection during times of danger. </p>\n\n<p>I was privileged enough to visit the Sant Angelo castle and National Museum of Castel Sant'Angelo which is like stepping into history, a home to various exhibits ranging from Renaissance paintings, sculptures antique military weapons as my photographs show.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_064024864.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_063946524.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_064053454.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2017/09/InShot_20170910_100014049.jpg\" alt=\"alt\" /></p>\n\n<h6 id=\"2colosseum\">2 |<strong>Colosseum</strong></h6>\n\n<p>The Colosseum or as known in Italian, \"Collesso\", also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an oval amphitheatre situated in the heart of Rome, Italy. Built of concrete and sand, it is the largest amphitheatre ever built in the history. The Colosseum is located east of the Roman Forum. It boasts 80 arched entrances allowing easy access to 55,000 spectators, who were seated according to rank. </p>\n\n<p>Be prepared for lots of walking when visiting the Colosseum.

Over three days, we explored the city by foot (as we were staying quite central) soaking up the relaxed and vibrant culture that the city had to offer. \n\nAmsterdam has so much to offer that we couldn’t manage to do all of it in one trip but just enough to hopefully return again.  \n\nThis wonderful city deserves so much more than just the few days than travellers give it, however, if all you have is a couple of days, like me, you'll want to make the most of it, and here is a brief itinerary of what I would give to a first-time traveller visiting Amsterdam for the first time.\n\n######Canal tour\n\nAmsterdam is a city surround by water. The canals of Amsterdam are incredibly beautiful, and picturesque. there’s nothing like seeing the city from a boat. Skip the big canal boat tours you see around the city — they’re overpriced. You can often hire a private boat tour for about 20 Euros an hour (look for guides around the Red Light District). Moreover, you can also take the open-air Canal Hopper Small Boat. This is the company I use when I run group tours to the city — the boats are small, the tours more intimate, and your driver will give you a good personalized tour. The tours last about an hour.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum is located right next to the Van Gogh Museum, and after years of renovation, it’s now beautifully remodeled. The museum still features an extensive Rembrandt collection, and you’ll be able to see the famous painting “The Night Watch.” Besides Rembrandt, there’s also an incredible and robust collection of other classic Dutch painters, like Frans Hals and Johannes Vermeer. Over one million works of art, craftworks, and historical objects are kept in the collection, and around 8,000 objects are on display in the museum so be sure to budget a few hours!\nFOAMThis photography museum houses wonderful pictures and sees few crowds despite being in the main part of the city. It’s a must for any photography lover. The exhibitions are constantly changing so you never know what you might see! They have a beautiful outdoor garden too. It’s a small museum and doesn’t take long to see.\nI have mixed feelings about zoos.\n\nI don't like seeing animals contained, but I don't like to see them die in the wild through human or natural causes either.\n\nThat said, I've been intrigued by Artis Zoo for quite some time,  not least because I have cycled and sailed around it on a number of occasions, seen the heads of giraffe pop up over a fence and started to wonder what lies within.\n\nLast week, with my 18 month old nephew visiting, I found out!\nIn all honesty, I don’t like this place. I found it to be anticlimactic. You basically do a slow walk through the house as the crowds pack the place. You don’t get to let everything soak in as you’re being pushed from behind by the endless crowds. It’s maddening! But, if you don’t mind waiting in line and you’re curious about Anne (I think the Jewish History Museum does a more thorough job of relating the events in Anne Frank’s life to the Holocaust), it might be worth the visit for you. You can book tickets online up to two months in advance, which lets you skip the line. If you don’t do this, get there very early in the morning to avoid the long queue that develops over the course of the day!\n",
