Hello....

My name is Annie, and I welcome you warmly to my personal blog and home for my thoughts, feelings, ideas and all the things that inspire me as an individual.

Over recent months, I have come to learn and appreciate that life is such a precious, and wondrous gift that should be held sacred and enjoyed by doing the things YOU love and feel most passionate about.

I am actively pursuing this personal goal of mine through my love for art, crafts and photography, of which, I'll be sharing on here in the next coming months.

Blogging is a new found love for me so, I hope its content will provide you inspiration to start thinking about living your life to the absolute fullest and to follow all those hidden dreams like I have begun to.

Let's start this journey together by doing what we love.

*Much love,*

*Annie x*
